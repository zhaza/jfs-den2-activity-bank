# Form-Input

* For this activity you are tasked to gather the users information from the form in the index.html

* Use DOM variables and the .value property to access the users input.

* You can also use document.forms["formName"] to crate a form object to use. You can access the input values by their "id" or assign them a "name" attribute.
